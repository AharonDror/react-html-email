# react-html-email [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chromakode/react-html-email.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chromakode/react-html-email) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/chromakode/react-html-email/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/chromakode/react-html-email?branch=master)

[react-html-email](https://github.com/chromakode/react-html-email) simplifies writing HTML email templates using React. It provides a set of components for a standard 600px table layout (inspired by [HTML Email Boilerplate](https://github.com/seanpowell/Email-Boilerplate)) and facilitates best practices such as consistent use of inline styles. In addition, a `style` prop validator is included which uses [Campaign Monitor's CSS Support Guide](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/) to check for potential compatibility issues across email clients.
